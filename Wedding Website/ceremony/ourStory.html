            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <hr class="style15">
	<p> 
	We first met in college and that's when the crazyness began.
	we had the kind of friendship that got us kicked out of college librarys for hugging and laughing too loud.
			
	but the best thing was that we didn't care and we made the most of our time together.
		
	</p>
	<hr>
	
	<p>
	After College had finished we both went seperate ways,
	until we found each other again one day at the same University.
	It felt like our own fate because we always managed to find each other.
	</p>
<hr>
	
	<p>
	We had nights out Owl Hunting, days in playing band hero none-stop and pancakes in-between.
	Then after one extra fun night out we shared our first kiss together.
	</p>
<hr>
	
	<p>
	The relationship between us grew bigger than the sun and we become inseperable. 
	This is very cheesy so beware and about to have your heart tugged. 
	Our days were simple and fun, from having silly bickerings, wearing band t shirs and being obsessed with Foo fighters. 
	Those days were so simple but were some of the best of our lives.
	</p>
<hr>
	
	<p>
	After Graduation, we decided to find our own place together. It wasn't the same as being at Univeristy and sharing a house with 6 other people,
	but we remained the same. After getting moved in, it was the two of us with a place to call our own. 
	
	Ayshe's first birthday gift to Tom, after a few months of going out, was two Bearded Dragons.
	Now after we have moved into the house together we extended that little family and got a little furrball called Enzo.
	Then shortly after another little Kitten called Gizmo.....who should have been called Nimrod!
	Though they can be super annoying they are cute additions to our lives.
	
	</p>
<hr>
	
	<p>
	
	On the 15th of June, 2015, Tom told Ayshe to dress up nice as he wanted to take some photos in the park for our Anniversary.
	She did so thinking it was a cute idea.
	
	When we got to the park and to our favourite bench, Tom set the camera up to 'video record'.
	He, then returned to an unsuspecting Ayshe (who was getting her photo face ready) went down on one knee and asked..
	
	<p>"Would you make me the happiest man alive and marry me!"</p>
	
	<p>
	Ayshe saying "yes" is the single happiest moment of our lives.

	(if you really want to see what happened yourself, there is a super-cheesy video at the bottom of the Gallery page on this site)
		
	</p>
<hr>
	
	<p>
	We feel extrememly lucky to have found someone who understands each other completely and who can put up with each others nonsense :)
	But mostly, we feel excited to be sharing our biggest moment in our life together with our family and friends.
